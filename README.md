# FlaskWithWebsockets

This project is an exercise in implementing a Flask web server that will act as an
intermediary between two clients. All communication between the server and the clients
will be using web sockets. A large part of the code implemented on the server is derived 
from Miguel Grinberg: https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/index
